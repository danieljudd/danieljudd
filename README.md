#  My workflow
I'm working on smaller projects and courses right now until I find a new direction to pursue, please send me anything free and interesting to look at (programming, practical, insights, courses, books, jobs).

Used various CMS to blog over the years (one for each hobby). I also like to implement my own themes and functions.

I primarily use Git to control my files and for backup and restoration.

Current using Windows 10 and Debian for when things need to get done - I'm a fan of stability and security. 

Usually daily, I like to scribble and plan the most productive things in a small and plain notebook.

I have no preferred IDE, but I like debuggers that work well and remains in my set PATH variable.
